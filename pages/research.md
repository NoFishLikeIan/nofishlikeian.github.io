## Economics

- [**The Cost of Uncertainty in Irreversible Climate Tipping Points**](../static/docs/tipping-point.pdf) (2023 - ongoing) - Under Revision
    Using an integrated assessment model with a climate tipping point, I quantify the economic cost of uncertainty by comparing a "wishful thinker" planner who delays abatement with a "cautious" planner who acts early, finding uncertainty can reduce world output by up to 2.36%. The results show that cautious, early abatement is generally cheaper than gambling on the chance of avoiding a tipping point.

- [**Endogenous Fragility of Supply Chains and Correlated Disruption Risk**](../static/docs/endfrag.pdf) (2022 - 2024) - Under Review
    Models the endogenous formation of supply chains under correlated disruptions, showing that greater correlation among upstream producers reduces downstream diversification incentives and can trigger widespread under-diversification and large welfare losses; improved information about supply-chain risk can further exacerbate these losses.

### Work in progress

- **An NLP analysis of institutional investorâ€™s stance towards environmental sustainability** (with [Davide Grossi](https://davidegrossi.me/), [Alessio M. Pacces](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/p/a/a.m.pacces/a.m.pacces.html), [Xinyi Wang](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/x.wang/x.wang.html)) (2022 - ongoing)
    We use computational techniques to identify influence of institutional shareholders on corporate decision-making.

- **Options can stabilise markets** with Donald Hagesteijn and [Cars Hommes](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/h/o/c.h.hommes/c.h.hommes.html) (2024 - ongoing)
    We show that trading binary at-the-money put option can stabilise markets and mitigate bubble formation, in asset pricing models with trend-following agents

## Neuroscience

- **Bayesian Model of Motion Extrapolation** (with [Philippa Johnson](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/philippa-johnson)) - 2022
    We model the brain compensation of neural delays in motion perception.
