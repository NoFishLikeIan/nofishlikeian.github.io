Hello! I am Andrea Titton. I am a Postdoc at the University of Bologna, modelling firms' expectations on the climate transition, working under the [BELIEFs project](https://site.unibo.it/beliefs/en).

I did my PhD at the [CeNDEF group](https://cendef.uva.nl/) of the University of Amsterdam and the [Tinbergen Institute](https://tinbergen.nl/), under the supervision of [Florian Wagener](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/w/a/f.o.o.wagener/f.o.o.wagener.html) and [Cees Diks](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/d/i/c.g.h.diks/c.g.h.diks.html). 

My research focuses on both transition risk and climate risk. I have worked on climate tipping points and their economic consequences. I am more broadly interested in environmental economics and game theory, particularly differential and network games. 

You can find my work in progress under [research](/research) and my [CV here](static/docs/titton-cv.pdf).

### On the side

I like maths and computers. I use [Julia](github.com/NoFishLikeIan/carbon-tipping-point) and [Python](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/nlp-financial-env) for work. I play around with [Prolog](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/prolog-playground) and [Clojure](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/dietary-monitor). I like games of no chance, mainly [chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) and [domineering](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/domineering/). I also like [hot water bottles](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle.html) and economic history, especially history of central banking.
